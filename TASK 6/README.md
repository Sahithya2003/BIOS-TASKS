# WHAT ARE RELAY AND REPLAY ATTACKS?
## WHAT IS A RELAY ATTACK?
- In a relay attack, an attacker intercepts communication between two parties and then, without viewing or manipulating it, relays it to another device. For example, a thief could capture the radio signal from your vehicle’s key fob and relay it to an accomplice who could use it to open your car door. 
## WHAT IS A REPLAY ATTACK?
- In replay attacks, the criminal steals the contents of a message (e.g. an authentication message) and sends it to the original, intended destination. For example, a thief could capture the signal from the remote you use to open your keyless front door, store it, and use it later to open the door while you are out, i.e. replay the message.
# BREAKING A CAR KEY FOB!!!
- Many new cars now have keyless entry systems, or can have them added as an upgrade. This allows the driver to open and start the car without using a button or turning a key so long as the fob is nearby.
- Thieves are exploiting this, using sophisticated technology to hack into your car’s computer, meaning they don’t even need a key fob to start the vehicle and can drive it away in a matter of minutes. The most at-risk are cars that use keyless fobs, as well as ‘connected cars. In other words, those that use the internet to access maps, travel info, and music – basically anything with an internet-enabled infotainment system.
- A relay attack usually involves two people working together. One stands by the targeted vehicle, while the other stands near the house with a device that can pick up a signal from the key fob. What’s more, some devices can pick up a signal from over 100 meters away.
-Key fobs are always listening out for signals broadcast from their car but the key fob needs to be quite close to the car so the car’s antenna can detect the signal and automatically unlock the car. Criminals can use radio amplification equipment to boost the signal of a fob that is out of range of the car (e.g. inside the owner’s home), intercept the signal, and transmit it to a device placed near the car. This device then sends the “open sesame” message it received to the car to unlock it and give access to the thief
## HOW THIS WORKS(IN SHORT)
1.The first thief sends a signal to a car, impersonating a key fob
2.The car replies with a request for authentication
3.This signal is transmitted to the second thief, stationed near the real key fob, e.g. in a restaurant or mall
4.The second thief relays this signal to the fob
5.The fob replies with its credentials
6.The second thief relays the authentication signal to the first thief who uses it to unlock the car
